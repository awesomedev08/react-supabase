# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for reading this guide and we appreciate any contribution.

## Ask a Question

You can use the repository's [Discussions](https://github.com/tmm/react-supabase/discussions) page to ask any questions, post feedback or share your experience on how you use this library.

## Report a Bug

Whenever you find something which is not working properly, please first search the repository's [Issues](https://github.com/tmm/react-supabase/issues) page and make sure it's not reported by someone else already.

If not, feel free to open an issue with the detailed description of the problem and the expected behavior. And reproduction (for example a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) link) will be extremely helpful.

## Request for a New Feature

For new features, it would be great to have some discussions from the community before starting working on it. You can either create an issue (if there isn't one) or post a thread in the [Discussions](https://github.com/tmm/react-supabase/discussions) page to describe the feature that you want to have.

If possible, you can add other additional context like how this feature can be implemented technically, what other alternative solutions we can have, etc.
